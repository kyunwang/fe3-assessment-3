## Description

## Data
The [data][dataLink] is from [FiveThirthyEight][dataSource]. The dataset contains data about police killing in the U.S. in the year 2015 from the start of the year till the second of June.

## D3 features used

## Features
Filtering by cause of death.

Viewing detail by hovering a location/circle.

Filtering by ethnicity via the piechart (not ready)

## Tools used?

## Problems encountered
The official data for the us map from D3 was faulty and I have wasted some hours trying to fix that and searching for a working dataset.

Plotting the locations/circles on the map.

## Known bugs
- After zooming in by clicking a state. When you zoom out it will be jumpy.
